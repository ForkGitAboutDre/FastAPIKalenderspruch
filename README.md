Endpoint, which gives back a **german** calendar saying.

Resolve your dependencies with:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Afterwards you can start your server with:

```sh
uvicorn main:app 
```
For further details, I would refer you to the API Documentation located at:

`localhost:8000/docs`
